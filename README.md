# Airbnb-Python-Project


## Overview
This project explores and analyzes Airbnb listings using Python. It includes key insights, visualizations, and an interactive dashboard for deeper data exploration. The dashboard uses Dash and Plotly to enable interactive data analysis with filters and visualizations.


## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Clean and preprocess the data for accurate insights.
- Conduct univariate, bivariate, and geospatial analyses to identify patterns and trends.
- Build an interactive dashboard to make the insights accessible to users.


## Database Insights
- id: Unique identifier for the listing.
- name: Name of the listing.
- host_id: Unique identifier for the host.
- neighbourhood_group: Broad location area of the listing (e.g., Manhattan, Brooklyn).
- room_type: Room type (e.g., Entire home/apt, Private room).
- price: Nightly price of the listing.
- number_of_reviews: Total reviews received for the listing.
- availability_365: Number of days available in a year.
- latitude and longitude: Coordinates for geospatial analysis.


## Features of the Project
1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies for accurate analysis.
2. EDA:
- Univariate Analysis: Distribution and trends of individual variables (e.g., price, room type).
- Bivariate Analysis: Relationships between two variables (e.g., price vs. reviews).
- Sentiment Analysis: Understanding review sentiments using text analysis techniques.
- Geospatial Analysis: Visualizing listings on a map to analyze neighborhood trends.
3. Interactive Dashboard:
- Dropdown Filter: Allows users to filter data by neighbourhood_group.
- Pie Chart: Displays the distribution of room_type for the selected neighbourhood_group.
- Scatter Plot: Explores the relationship between price and number_of_reviews.
